# Contributing

Do you have a category that you'd like to add? Feel free to open a PR with your new category, or edits to an existing category.

## `exprs.rs`

Add your new category to the `HASHMAP` defined in this module. The plugin wil automatically pick up the 
new category. You should prefer a lower case name with hyphens seperating words such as `rust-language`.

## `CATEGORIES.md`

Add the new category to `CATEGORIES.md`. The description doesn't need to be in-depth, but should give the 
key used by `Rustplacements`, and a short description of what it replaces your text with.

## Appropriate Content

Content should generally be inoffensive. The rust community prides itself on being an inclusive community that
welcomes diversity across age, gender, socio-economic status, and race. The categories in this repo should 
reflect that. Therefore, content deemed inappropriate or offensive will not be merged into this repository.
